TIDES

Toolkit for Immunogenomic Data Exchange and Storage

DATABASE

TIDES uses a database to store information and has been developed and
tested with PostgreSQL. The following commands set up the database:

	createdb tides
	psql -f schema.sql tides

The schema assumes existence of a www-data user for database access from
the web server.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

To specify an installation root of /home/foo, replace the first line
above with

	perl Build.PL --install_base /home/foo

By default HTML and CSS files install to /var/www/html.  If you want
to install these files elsewhere, specify an install_path for htdocs to
the perl or install commands, e.g., either of

	perl Build.PL --install_path htdocs=/foo/path/html
	./Build install --install_path htdocs=/foo/path/html

will cause installation of the HTML and CSS files to /foo/path/html.
If the htdocs directory is not the HTML document root, then the path to
tides.css in lib/TIDES/header.tmpl needs to be adjusted accordingly.
